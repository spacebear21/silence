## Inspiration

"Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something" - Plato 

Why: The `datacarrier` configuration was highly controversial on the Bitcoin Core github repository. It came to a point where the repository was basically a copy-paste of twitter. 
What: We want to incentivize self constraint by imposing a cost to commenting on github.

## What it does

We connect a LN wallet through an API which enables lightning payments to be associated with commenting on Github.

## How we built it

By vibecoding an extensions that connects a LN wallet to a github account.

## Challenges we ran into

Finding a safe LN API, keeping funds safe for users, making sure people actually start downloading the extension

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

A working chrome extension

## What we learned

How to write a fake LN wallet

## What's next for silence payments

Make it actually use Bitcoin
